#WWW files to be served up through HTTP

This is where you should place your web files that are exposed to the network. 
Files will be served up as is with no modifications just like apache or other web servers.

Any other media/binary files you want to use should go here instead of the normal html folder.


This is also your chance to deliver different folders to different host names. This is common for servers that have more than one web server on them.
