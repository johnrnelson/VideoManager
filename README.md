#Quick and Easy Video Upload Manager
This is an example project to show how easy it is to use JavaScript for almost everything. It is a working demo and can be used at home for lightweight videos (small file size) and multiple users at a time.

#Installation
You will need Node.js for this bad boy. Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
<https://nodejs.org>. Every OS has an options so have fun with it.

Once it's installed check the installation.

```
node -v
```

Download the zip file and extract it to a brand new folder. Open a command line in that folder and
use node to open the SERVER.js file from this project.
```
node SERVER.js
```


* **Server**: Tested on linux.
* **Client**: Tested on Chrome.


#Goals
Let's see what we can do with some JavaScript.

##Features
Allow a user to upload and download their MP4 videos. 

##Original Design Goals
Sent to me on  Sunday March 20th 2016:

The goal of this project is to create a web application with the following goals:

- A user needs to be able to upload any video to the web application server
- The uploader should only be able to upload the mp4 file types
- All other file types should be blocked
- After the video has been uploaded, the user should be able to replay this video from the web application
- Unit and integration tests should be created


Notes:
- Please create a public github repo for this project
- Please make as many commits as it makes sense to other developers
- Create a README so someone else can build this web application on another computer from cloning the repo to test it out
- You can use any language but we do prefer it being in ruby or javascript. If it is not in these languages, please note, we will need instructions to get it running starting from what dependencies are needed :)
- Any notes or thoughts while building it are appreciated.
