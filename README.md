#Quick and Easy Video Uploads


** Found some bugs and new features to add so still working on it. 

** Yes I will complete the documentation. I'm not just putting it off. lol

#Installation
You will need Node.js for this bad boy. Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at
<https://nodejs.org>. Every OS has an options so have fun with it.

Once it's installed check the installation.

```
node -v
```

Download the zip file and extract it to a brand new folder. Open a command line in that folder and
use node to open the SERVER.js file from this project.
```
node SERVER.js
```


* **Server**: Tested on linux.
* **Client**: Tested on Chrome.


##Original Design Goals Sunday March 20th 2016
The goal of this project is to create a web application with the following goals:

- A user needs to be able to upload any video to the web application server
- The uploader should only be able to upload the mp4 file types
- All other file types should be blocked
- After the video has been uploaded, the user should be able to replay this video from the web application
- Unit and integration tests should be created


Notes:
- Please create a public github repo for this project
- Please make as many commits as it makes sense to other developers
- Create a README so someone else can build this web application on another computer from cloning the repo to test it out
- You can use any language but we do prefer it being in ruby or javascript. If it is not in these languages, please note, we will need instructions to get it running starting from what dependencies are needed :)
- Any notes or thoughts while building it are appreciated.
